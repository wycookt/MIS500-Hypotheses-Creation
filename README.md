# MIS500-Hypotheses-Creation
Hypotheses are defined as:

“Hypotheses are single tentative guesses, good hunches—assumed for use in devising theory or planning experiments intended to be given a direct experimental test when possible” (Rogers, 1966).
“Hypothesis is a formal statement that presents the expected relationship between an independent and dependent variable” (Cresswell, 1994).
“Hypothesis is a statement or explanation that is suggested by knowledge or observation but has not, yet, been proved or disproved” (Macleod & Hockey, 1981).
The null hypothesis represents a theory that has been put forward, either because it is believed to be true or because it is to be used as a basis for argument but has not been proved. The null hypothesis offers close to null prediction. 

The hypothesis actually to be tested is usually given the symbol H0 and is commonly referred to as the null hypothesis. The null hypothesis is assumed to be true unless there is strong evidence to the contrary —similar to how a person is assumed to be innocent until proven guilty.

The alternative hypothesis is a statement of what a hypothesis test is set up to establish. The other hypothesis, which is assumed to be true when the null hypothesis is false, is referred to as the alternative hypothesis and is often symbolized by HA or H1.

It is opposite the Null Hypothesis.
It is only reached if H0 is rejected.
Frequently, the “alternative” is actually the desired conclusion of the researcher!
For this assignment, select two different business research scenarios you are interested in testing.

Write a set of hypotheses for each scenario.

Each set must include the Null Hypothesis and the Alternative Hypothesis. You must cite at least three references for this assignment.

Submit your assignment in a Word document with title and reference pages formatted according to the CSU-Global Guide to Writing and APA (Links to an external site.).
